# Planning-Battery-Electric-Bus-Systems
This repository contain code on "Planning Battery Electric Bus Systems: No One-Size-Fits-All Solution for Cost and Emissions Across Climates and Chemistries". The main directory include the code, results and the manuscript of the following paper.

## Usage

To run the simulation interactively, execute the `Main.m` script. A graphical user interface (GUI) will prompt you to select the desired battery chemistry and city (region). 

Once selected, the script will automatically run simulations for battery capacities ranging from **140 kWh to 320 kWh** in 1 kWh increments. The output data for each configuration will be saved in a corresponding folder named `Data_<BatteryType>_<Region>`

## Requirements
Matlab 2024b

## Results
The results can be found on Figshare with the identifier Dataset 10.25909/29323673.v1
